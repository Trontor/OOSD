# Workshop 2 - I/O and Arrays

## Java Theory

Suppose x1 and x2 are variables that have been given values. Discuss the differences (and reasoning) in checking equality of these variables if they are of type:

* int
* double
* String

***Checking the equality of int and double can be done using the equality operator (==) or x1.Equals(x2)***

***Checking the equality of the value of a string can only be done using x1.Equals(x2), the equality operator checks if they are the same object***

**The reason for this is that strings are stored in the the Java 'String pool'**
